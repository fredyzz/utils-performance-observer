# Performance observer implementation

## Basic custom performance observer implementation to send performance information.

The file should be loaded in the header of the index.html file:

`<script src="/utils/perf.js></script>`

If there is no special needment with this information or the place you should send it,
you can use [Google Core Web Vitals Library](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals).
That library is production ready.
